# Reddit - Website Clone

Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members.
We have built Sign-up/Sign-in page, Home page, profile page which are fetched by our own made API from backend server.
We would thank a well known open source management tool — “GIT” which made storing and modifying all the files in an organized branches.

### Login Page:

In Sign-up page new users can create their own account where the user can experience the App in much simpler way. This basically makes easier for the user to make their preferences which can be stored in the database and display the posts based on their preferences. In Sign-in page already registered user can login into the website using their login credentials.<br/>
